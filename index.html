          <h3>Thanks to the professor</h3>
          <p>
            I just wanted to start off by saying thank you for taking the time
            to lay out and provide the instructions within this course. Your
            hard work is greatly appreciated.
          </p>
          <h3>What am I interested in?</h3>
          <h4>| Backend Development | Managing Data | Python |</h4>
          <h4><em>But Why?...</em></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Because</em> I'd like to deepening my programming chops. I
              want to see tons of code and be able to follow along with complex
              patterns and understand what makes code reusable and clean.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Because</em> I decided to focuse and dedicate myself to
              backend development and want to specialize in Python, APIs. I want
              to learn how to utilize databases as well as server communication
              basics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Because</em> I realized I'm not a visual type person even
              though I do like eye catching pieces of art. I found myself more
              interested in the behind the scenes aspect of web development and
              want to further my understanding of how businesses and the public
              interact with their data and services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>And finally</em>, because I'd like to contribute to CI/CD
              (continuous integration and continuous deployment) which is the
              next concept I want to learn.
