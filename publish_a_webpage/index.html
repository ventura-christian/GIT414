          <h3>Big Thanks</h3>
          <p>
            I want to begin by thanking you for taking the time to clearly lay
            out the instructions for this course. Your effort and attention to
            detail are greatly appreciated.
          </p>
          <h3>What am I interested in?</h3>
          <h4>| Backend Development | Managing Data | Python | APIs |</h4>
          <h4><em>But why?</em></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Because</em> my goal is to deepen my programming skills. I
              want to see extensive examples of code, follow along with complex
              patterns, and better understand what makes code reusable and
              clean.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Because</em> I’ve chosen to dedicate myself to backend
              development, specializing in Python and APIs. I want to strengthen
              my skills in database management and server communication
              fundamentals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Because</em> I realized I’m not drawn to the visual side of
              web development, even though I appreciate well-designed,
              eye-catching work. Instead, I find myself more engaged with the
              behind-the-scenes aspects where I can understand how businesses
              and the public interact with data and services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Finally</em>, I want to build toward contributing to CI/CD
              (continuous integration and continuous deployment), which is the
              next major area I plan to explore.
