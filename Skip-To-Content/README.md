Overview

This assignment explores web accessibility by testing screen readers, simulating visual impairments, and implementing skip links in a webpage. The goal is to understand how users with disabilities experience websites and to practice building accessible navigation with skip links.

• Color blindness
• Dyslexia
• Myopia / Blurred vision
• Blindness
• Tunnel vision / Peripheral vision loss 3. Created a skip link page in CodePen following the guide from CSS-Tricks: “How to Create a ‘Skip to Content’ Link”. 4. Built a semantic HTML page with the following structure:
• <header>
• <nav>
• <main>
• <footer> 5. Added Skip to Main Content functionality with HTML and CSS for improved accessibility.

Technologies Used
• HTML5
• CSS3
• CodePen.io

Usage 1. Open the CodePen link provided in the submission. 2. Use the Tab key to navigate the page. 3. The Skip to Content link will appear as the first focusable element, allowing users to bypass navigation and jump directly to the <main> content.
