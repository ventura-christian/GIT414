        <p>
          Our company began as a small, chef-run concept with the belief that we
          could help our friends feed their families the food that they loved,
          in the time that they had, without needing to be professionally
          trained as chefs. We worked together performing research for three
          years, first with our friends and family, them with other locals, then
          across the country, to make sure that we understood the needs of our
          audeince. We want you to love what you eat!
        </p>
        <p>
          Chef YumYum is small but mighty, and we are here to help! You can find
          free recipes here on our site to get you started, and to give you an
          idea of what we offer our customers. We want you to feel like family,
          and our family eats
          <em>very</em>
          well. YumYum!
